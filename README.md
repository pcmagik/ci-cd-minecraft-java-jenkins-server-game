# CI/CD for Minecraft Java Server in Jenkins using Docker! ðŸš€

I took on the challenge of automating the deployment and testing process for a Minecraft Java server using Jenkins, Docker, and some clever stages within the Jenkinsfile. Below, you'll find a breakdown of the entire pipeline, which might be helpful for anyone wanting to explore CI/CD in the gaming world!

In the Jenkinsfile, the pipeline is divided into several stages, each ensuring a smooth workflow:

1. **Stage Clone Repository** - Initially, we clone the repository to ensure we are working with the latest codebase. This is a fundamental step to ensure all following stages operate on the newest version.

2. **Stage Build Docker Image** - We create a Docker image that contains the Minecraft Java server. We pull the base image, configure all required dependencies, and then build our custom Docker image, which forms the backbone of our entire automation process.

3. **Stage Test Docker Image** - After building the image, we test it by running a container in a test environment. This allows us to verify that all the necessary files are present and that the server environment is set up correctly.

4. **Stage Deploy to Test Environment** - We deploy the server to a test machine using Docker, and Jenkins starts the container with the appropriate port settings. We verify that the server started successfully by analyzing the container logs.

5. **Stage Automated Tests** - We run automated tests to ensure the server is accessible and the ports are properly exposed. These tests are essential to verify that everything is functioning correctly before moving to production.

6. **Stage Backup Existing Production** - Before deploying to production, we back up the current production state to ensure we can restore it if something goes wrong.

7. **Stage Deploy to Production** - Once tests pass successfully, we deploy the latest server image to the production environment, stopping and replacing any existing containers. If needed, we restore the latest backup of the world data.

8. **Stage Monitor Production Server** - Finally, we monitor the production server, ensuring that it is running correctly, and that the ports are properly exposed to ensure a smooth experience for players.

This entire pipeline is designed to work seamlessly both locally and in cloud environments like Oracle Cloud, making it a versatile solution for multiple setups. Docker ensures portability and repeatability, which are crucial in this context.
